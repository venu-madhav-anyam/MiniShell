# MiniShell
The project aims to build a mini-shell mimicking BASH using Linux system calls and IPC mechanisms like signals. It will handle user commands, support piping, variables, and special keyboard actions (e.g., Control-C). The shell will also read commands from scripts, and can be extended with features like command history.
